Self-learning ioBroker adapter for automatic detection of washing machine and dryer cycles via smart plug power measurement. Recognizes running programs, estimates remaining time and sends Telegram notifications – fully local, no cloud.

> **Alpha release.** Tested on Siemens iQ washing machine and dryer. Other brands and models may require tuning. Feedback welcome.

## How it works

LaundryLens records the power consumption curve of each cycle and compares it against stored program profiles using segment-weighted correlation and a DTW-lite algorithm. Confidence is accumulated over multiple matching rounds before a program is accepted, which prevents single outliers from triggering a wrong match. Remaining time is estimated dynamically based on both elapsed time and the current energy rate – not just a fixed average.

The adapter is self-learning: there are no pre-built profiles. Every program is trained on your specific device. Recognition improves with each completed cycle.

## Features

- Cycle detection via state machine (OFF → STARTING → RUNNING ↔ PAUSED → ENDING)
- Self-learning program matching (segment-weighted correlation + DTW tiebreak)
- Score accumulation over multiple rounds with device-specific confidence thresholds
- Override lock: manually selected programs are not overwritten by background matching
- Adaptive remaining time estimation combining time-based and energy-rate signals
- Admin UI with expandable cycle list, inline power graph (canvas), phase legend, trim and split per touch/drag
- Telegram notifications with configurable update thresholds, placeholders (`{progress}`, `{prevTime}`) and conditional text blocks
- Multiple devices: one instance per device (washing machine, dryer, …)

---

## Requirements

- ioBroker with js-controller ≥ 5.0.0
- Node.js ≥ 18
- A smart plug or power meter adapter providing a watt data point per device (e.g. Shelly EM)

---

## Installation

Install via ioBroker Admin: **Adapters → ⚙ → Install from custom URL**

```
https://github.com/backfisch88/ioBroker.laundrylens
```

Then create a separate adapter instance for each device and select the watt data point in the instance configuration.

## Configuration

Each instance has the following settings:

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| Device name | Display name for this device |
| Device type | `washing_machine` or `dryer` (affects phase detection logic) |
| Power sensor (W) | ioBroker data point providing watt values |
| Power threshold (W) | Minimum wattage to consider the device as running |
| Off delay (min) | Time to wait after power drops before ending the cycle |
| Start energy gate (Wh) | Minimum energy consumed before matching starts (filters short spikes) |
| Duration tolerance | Allowed deviation from learned average duration (0.05–0.5) |
| Matching interval (min) | How often matching runs during a cycle |
| Match confirmations | Number of consecutive rounds a match must hold before being accepted |
| Auto-confirm threshold (%) | Confidence at which a match is confirmed automatically |
| Instant-confirm threshold (%) | Confidence at which a match is accepted immediately (2 rounds in a row) |
| Program detection threshold (%) | Minimum confidence for a candidate to be considered at all |
| Notify on probable match | Send a notification even before a match is officially confirmed |
| Ignore anti-crease | Ignore anti-crease phases at the end of dryer cycles |

The defaults are tuned for Siemens iQ appliances. Detection threshold is a trade-off: lower means faster notifications but higher risk of wrong matches. Some experimentation is expected.

## Data points per device

| Data point | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `state` | string | off / starting / running / paused / ending |
| `running` | boolean | Simple on/off indicator |
| `program` | string | Detected program name |
| `confidence` | number | Match confidence in % |
| `timeRemaining` | number | Estimated remaining time in seconds |
| `totalDuration` | number | Estimated total cycle duration in seconds |
| `cycleProgress` | number | Cycle progress 0–100 % |
| `phase` | string | Current cycle phase |
| `lastCycleProgram` | string | Program of the last completed cycle |
| `lastCycleDuration` | number | Duration of the last cycle in minutes |
| `lastCycleEnergy` | number | Energy consumed in the last cycle in Wh |

## Getting started tips

- Let the device run at least 3–5 cycles per program before expecting reliable detection.
- Start with fewer programs. The fewer profiles you have, the higher the match accuracy.
- Use the **Cycles tab** in the admin UI to review past cycles, trim noise from the start/end of a recorded trace, or split a trace that captured two programs.
- Use the **Export** function before any update to back up your learned profiles and cycle history.

## Changelog

### 0.2.4 (2026-07-11)
- Fix: power sensor readings with `ack=false` were silently ignored, causing the adapter to stay "off" forever even at full power. This affects power sensors fed by user scripts (common for `0_userdata.0.*` datapoints) that don't explicitly set `ack: true`.

### 0.2.3 (2026-07-07)
- Fix: `startEnergyThreshold = 0` (and `powerThreshold = 0`) was silently replaced by the default value due to a falsy-zero check — this blocked correct detection for devices with a very low initial power draw (e.g. dishwashers during pump-out)
- Fix: restarting the adapter while the device was already running (with no cycle to restore) could leave the cycle stuck in "starting" instead of resuming "running"

### 0.2.2 (2026-07-01)
- beta release
